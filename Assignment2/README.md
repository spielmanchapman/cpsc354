# Critical Overview

# Part 1

## In Part 1 of the assignment, we modified the grammar in LambdaNat1.cf 
## to account for ENat0, and ENatS using two different cases for evalCBN and subst. 
## We did this by modifying some of the availble code in the Interpreter and
## testing different cases until we were satisfied with our answer.
